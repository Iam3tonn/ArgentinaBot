        "full_text": "Two Argentine-Israeli hostages held by Hamas were freed on Monday by Israeli forces in Rafah, near the Egyptian border.Fernando Marman and Louis Har who had been kidnapped in the Nir Yitzhak kibbutz were taken by helicopter to the Sheba hospital in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, where they were admitted at 3.15 a.m., the hospital confirmed.“Around three in the morning we got a call from Israeli authorities informing us that Fernando and Louis were back with us, that we please drive to the hospital to see them,” said Har’s son-in-law Idan Bejerano to AFP. “We were overwhelmed. We were not expecting this.”“We saw them […] there was a lot of crying, hugs, and only a few words spoken,” said Bejerano, who added that both of them are “getting medical care, in bed.”“They look OK, if I may say so. They are going through a series of tests, surrounded by doctors and nurses. And, most importantly, with their families,” he told the press outside the hospital.Bejerano also reiterated the demands of other hostages’ families, who urge the Israeli government to accept a new ceasefire with Hamas that includes therelease of more hostages.The hostages were freed after a ferocious rescue operation that killed 67 Palestinians in the southern Gaza city, where about one million civilians have sought refuge from months of bombardments.“Please, be serious! Be serious about an agreement. The Israeli people need an agreement […] as soon as possible,” said Bejerano.Argentina’s Office of the President congratulated Israeli armed forces for “successfully conducting the rescue” throughtheir X account.La Oficina del Presidente agradece a las Fuerzas de Defensa Israelíes, al Shabak y a la Policía israelí por haber culminado con éxito el rescate de los argentinos Fernando Simon Marman (60) y Louis Har (70), quienes estaban secuestrados desde el pasado 7 de octubre por el grupo…— Oficina del Presidente (@OPRArgentina)February 12, 2024Also on X, Israeli president Isaac Herzog greeted “everyone who brought Fernando and Luis back home in a bold rescue operation,” and promised that they will “continue to work through every means possible to bring all hostages back home.”The Gaza health ministry said 67 Palestinians had been killed overnight and the number could rise as rescue operations were underway. A Reuters journalist at the scene saw a vast area of rubble where buildings, including a mosque, had been destroyed. Israel says many of those killed are militants; the Gaza ministry says 70% are civilians.“I’ve been collecting my family’s body parts since the morning, said Ibrahim Hassouna, as a woman knelt over the body of a young child nearby. “I only recognized their toes or fingers.”An Israeli military spokesman said the hostages were being held on the second floor of a building that was breached with explosives during the raid amid heavy exchanges of gunfire with surrounding buildings.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered his Army to prepare an offensive on Rafah, where people displaced by the war are sheltering with nowhere else to go. Rafah currently concentrates more than half of Gaza’s population, according to the UN, which generated consternation in the international community.Hamas warned yesterday that such an offensive would “torpedo” any agreement to release hostages but Israel stated that the bombings were not part of that offensive but of the rescue operation. The attacks hit 14 houses and three mosques in different parts of Rafah, according to the government in Gaza.Marman and Har were among 250 people seized by the gunmen belonging to the Palestinian Islamist group governing the Gaza Strip during an incursion into southern Israel on October 7, 2023. More than four months on, much of the densely-populated strip of land on the Mediterranean is in ruins, with 28,340 Palestinians dead and 67,984 wounded, according to Gaza health officials, with many others believed to be buried under rubble.According to Israeli authorities, before the release of these two hostages, there were 132 hostages held by Hamas, of whom 29 probably died in captivity.A week-long truce in November freed 105 hostages in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons.Rafah has become the last refuge for Palestinians with 1.4 million people mostly displaced by the war, cornered on the closed border with Egypt, according to the UN.—Télam/Reuters",

        "full_text": "Last updated on October 31If you are traveling to or from Argentina, you might have Googled how much the peso is worth. And chances are that you didn’t get a straight answer.That’s because Argentina’s foreign exchange market is far from straightforward. Different administrations have added layer upon layer of restrictions on foreign currency operations over the years, spawning a myriad of different exchange rates.Since 2019, Argentines have not been allowed to go to a bank and simply buy all the dollars they want. So, they often get them at informal exchange houses at the higher “blue dollar” rate. They can turn to financial markets to get the greenback, but that gives them the “MEP dollar” and “blue-chip swap” rates — though the latter is not the same as the “blue dollar.” Confused yet?If not, you will be: there are also different exchange rates for credit card operations, which are not the same if you want to pay for, say, a Coldplay concert or Netflix. There are, of course, specific exchange rates for those, called “Coldplay Dollar” and “Netflix Dollar”.All these restrictions stem from the same problem, an international reserve scarcity crisis, which this year’s historic drought has intensified. At the time of writing, Argentina’s net international reserves are negative US$4.5 billion, meaning the country is beyond broke — in fact, the government would have to raise US$4.5 billion to be broke.Who can buy dollars at the “official rate”? Why is it called the “blue dollar” if the banknotes are green? Is the “Coldplay dollar” overrated? Without further ado, here is your guide to navigating the murky waters of the Argentine foreign exchange market.Official exchange rate (Dólar oficial)The official “wholesale” exchange rate is the cheapest and the largest market. All “wholesale” transactions are done directly with the Central Bank and every other official rate derives its value from this one. “Where can I get this rate?” you may ask. I hate to burst your bubble, but it’s used almost exclusively in international trade.Compared with the parallel rates, exporters get fewer pesos for every dollar of income and importers have to spend fewer pesos for every dollar of goods they buy. That’s why you often hear of companies getting caught exaggerating their imports — to access more cheap dollars — or under-declaring their exports.This government has used a policy called “crawling peg” to manage the exchange rate. While pegging a currency to the dollar means setting a fixed exchange rate, the crawling peg means the currency is systematically and gradually devalued by a tiny amount, at a rate set by the government. After years of this, the government finally devalued the peso the day after the presidential primaries, taking the official rate to AR$350 to the dollar. The government plans tohold this leveluntil November.That remains to be seen.Savers’ exchange rate or “Solidary” exchange rate (Dólar ahorro or solidario)The “dólar ahorro” (savings dollar) is the rate Argentines get by just exchanging pesos for dollars at a bank or exchange house into their domestic bank accounts. It’s the official retail exchange rate plus 100%, which derives from a combination of two taxes. The current value of thedólar ahorrois AR$735.5. Savers can claim part of the tax back at the end of the year — if they can figure out the byzantine systems of the tax bureau (There isa seven-step guidein our sister publication, Ámbito Financiero, in case you are interested).The quota fordólar ahorroenforced by the government of Mauricio Macri in 2019 to suffocate a bank run, which is still in place, is US$200 per month.However, not everyone can access thedólar ahorro. Scratch that, virtually nobody can. Restrictions on accessing dollars for personal savings are usually called thecepo— Spanish for “clamp.”The government has forbidden various groups of people from purchasing US dollars. The list is evergrowing and includes; workers whose salaries were partially paid by the government or received emergency welfare during the COVID-19 pandemic; people who are on welfare programs; investors who have bought US dollar bonds or cryptocurrencies; and people whose utility bills are subsidized by the government, among others.Blue dollar (Dólar blue)The “blue dollar” refers to cash dollars bought and sold informally. This exchange rate has its own ecosystem — people who sell it on the streets are calledarbolitos, Spanishfor “little trees.”Informal exchange houses are calledcuevas(caves).Restrictions for buyingdólar ahorroare the main reason why Argentines resort to the “blue dollar.” That and the prevalent distrust in the banking system, which deepened after the 2001 crisis when the government limited cash withdrawals at first and then forcibly exchanged US dollar deposits for Argentine pesos.Because of that, Argentines prefer to store their crisp banknotes at home — last year, the INDEC calculated that they had some US$249.5 billion under their mattresses.The “blue market” is not big, but most media outlets publish its value and it can be a bellwether of the economic mood. Depending on which side of the political divide you are on, the “blue dollar” can be called “free dollar” (since it’s how citizens can access the currency without any restrictions) or “illegal dollar” (as it is technically illegal, although the government somewhat tolerates it).There’s no consensus on where it got its name. Some say it refers to a special marker used to detect counterfeit bills which, when used on dollars, turns them blue. However, most people agree that it is called “blue” to avoid using the term “black market,” which could be interpreted as racist. So this could mean this illegal exchange rate is…kind of woke?MEP dollar and blue-chip swap rateThere is yet another way Argentines access the treasured exchange rate — purchasing and then selling national sovereign bonds. The maneuver consists of buying peso-denominated bonds in the financial and then selling them for dollars. The implicit rates of exchange at which those operations are carried out are the “financial exchange rates” — the MEP dollar, if they are done in the local market, and the blue-chip swap rate if they are done in the international market (in these cases, the money ends up in foreign bank accounts).That may sound complicated, but the appetite this country has for the greenback and the ongoing restrictions are increasingly more people investing in the market through various apps. Once relatively obscure terms, “MEP” and “blue-chip” are now mainstream and in the last couple of years, everyone’s become a trader.“Netflix” and “Qatar” dollarBut US dollars aren’t just for savings under the mattress. Sometimes, Argentines need to pay for things that are priced in dollars with their debit or credit card, namely streaming services, travel expenses abroad, or that really cute 1-1 scale My Little Pony figurine that I saw on eBay last night. Enter the “card dollar”, also called “tourist dollar”— its value is the same as the “saver’s dollar” (AR$735.5).Until October 10, the government had differentiated exchange rates popularly called “Qatar” and “Netflix”for overseas and domestic expenses respectively. The “Netflix” name is pretty self-explanatory, and the “Qatar” dollar was enforced in late 2022 when Argentines traveled en masse to a certain West Asian country to watch a certain sports event.However,the government unified the valuesfor the Qatar, Netflix andahorroexchange rates. Since then, you get the same exchange rate whether you watch the heartless 2022 remake of “Pinnocchio” or go hug a Disney World cast member dressed as the wooden puppet in Florida. Which is a normal state of affairs, I guess.Foreign tourist dollarAlthough technically not another exchange rate,the “foreign tourist dollar”is a measure launched by the government that allows tourists — or anyone with a foreign credit or debit card — to get their purchases in the country processed with the MEP rate. And no, it’s not the same as the regular tourist (or Qatar) dollar. Before the foreign tourist dollar was introduced, purchases were processed at the official rate (approximately 96% less).The government did this as a way to make the country cheaper for tourists and dissuade them from dangerously spelunking in dangerous “caves” or climbing “little trees.”Coldplay dollarWhen Coldplay sold out nine concerts in Buenos Aires last year, people started wondering which exchange rate they would use to take home the pesos thousands of Argentines paid to listen to “Fix You” or “Viva La Vida”?The rules would imply that it was the official rate, but businesspeople in the entertainment industry protested and got a special exchange rate of the sector, which was the official rate plus 30% (AR$455 at the time of writing). They could have settled for the official rate, but hey — if you never try, you’ll never know just what you’re worth.Temporary exchange ratesSometimes, the government launches exchange rates with expiry dates. For example, the “Vaca Muerta” dollar and the various iterations of the “agro dollar” or “soybean dollar” — beneficial rates aimed at oil or agricultural exporters that are higher than the official exchange rate. However, with the proposals of dollarization or “rapid exchange rate unification” some candidates are making, all of these exchange rates could soon be destined to the great rates chart in the sky.",

        "full_text": "President Javier Milei met on Thursday with relatives of Hamas hostages and visited a kibbutz that was attacked in the unprecedented October 7 raid.Milei has been inIsrael since Tuesdayon his first official state visit as president, in a show of support for the country in the context of the Israel-Hamas conflict.The president visited the kibbutz Nir Oz, 1.8 kilometers from the border with Gaza, which was hit hard during the attack. He spoke with survivors, including Argentine-Israeli dual nationals, and offered them words of support, his team said.During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, he reiterated his promises to officially designate Hamas as a terrorist group and to move Argentina’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.Hamas issued a statement saying that Milei’s plans constituted “an infringement of the rights of our Palestinian people to their land, and a violation of the rules of international law, considering Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian land.”Jerusalem is considered sacred in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, and both Palestine and Israel claim it as their own. The decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem thus constitutes a geopolitical gesture endorsing Israel’s claim to the city. The United States moved its embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, during Donald Trump’s presidency.Mieli also visited sacred sites in Israel including the Wailing Wall and several churches.On October 7, Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostages. In response, Israel unleashed a campaign of bombardment on the territory that has killed approximately 27,000 people and injured at least 65,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Large swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble.In January, the United Nations International Court of Justice ordered Israel to ensure it did not commit genocide in Gaza as it ruled in a case filed by South Africa. Netanyahu has called the genocide charges against Israel “ridiculous.”Argentines killed in Israel-Hamas warIt is believed that 21 Argentine nationals were kidnapped in the October 7 attack. Four Argentine-Israeli women werereleased in a prisoner swapin November. However, the fate of others remains uncertain: Hamas claimed that 10-month-old baby Kfir Bibas and his family had beenkilled in an Israeli raid, but their deaths could not be independently confirmed.At least nine Argentines lost their lives in the attack.Milei is accompanied on his trip by Presidency Secretary Karina Milei (who is also his sister), Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, and Argentina’s designated ambassador to Israel, Axel Wahnisch, who is a rabbi.From Israel, he will continue his trip to Italy and the Vatican, where he will meet Pope Francis on Monday.",
